      <h1>My origins</h1>
      <p>I first became aware of NASCAR back when I was a kid playing video games with NASCAR 07 on the XBOX.
        I was instantly drawn to the speed and excitement of the sport as I spent hours playing the game growing up as 
        shown in the video below.

      <div class="video-container">
      <video controls width="640" height="360">
    <source src="videos/nascar-highlight.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
  </video>
      </div>

      <p>However, while I attended a race in 2012 at the Auto Club Speedway, and played the games such as NASCAR 09 and NASCAR 2011 The Game,
        I didn't fully start following the sport until around 2015 when I randomly watched a Martinsville race on TV, where I became
        captivated by the intensity and strategy involved.
